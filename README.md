This repository contains my core system configuration.

The [`scripts`](scripts) directory contains scripts that perform the symlinking.

The [`utilities`](utilities) directory contains some small utilities implemented as shell scripts, and gets added to my `PATH`.

The [`macos`](macos) directory contains scripts to set up a new MacOS machine.
